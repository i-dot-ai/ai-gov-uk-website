challenge: Peterborough City Council was facing growing pressure on its adult social
  care teams. Practitioners often had to rely on one highly experienced colleague
  for guidance, especially when trying to find the right technology-enabled care (TEC)
  solutions. These are tools like sensors, apps, or devices that help people live
  more safely and independently in their own homes. Off-the-shelf commercial systems
  raised concerns about data privacy and did not reflect the specific local context
  and nuances.
solution: To address these challenges, the Council developed *Hey Geraldine,* a bespoke
  AI-powered knowledge assistant named in honour of Geraldine, a highly respected
  Occupational Therapist known for her deep expertise and willingness to support colleagues.
  The assistant was co-created with frontline staff to ensure it offers real-time,
  practical guidance and signposting on assistive technology and digital care solutions.
  Designed to reflect Geraldine's spirit of helpfulness, the AI tool is accessible
  24/7 and supports practitioners by answering detailed queries about TEC, helping
  them make faster, more informed decisions.
results: >-
  Early testing shows: 


  * A saving of 15 minutes per conversation for Occupational Therapists (OT), supporting better caseload management and prioritisation of complex cases. 

  * Over 1,200 questions asked, with many genuine queries demonstrating practical value. 

  * Responses were consistent with the real Geraldine's advice, boosting trust and adoption among staff.
learnings: >-
  * Developing a bespoke AI solution addressed data privacy concerns and embedded local
  nuances more effectively than off-the-shelf commercial products. 

  * Regular, structured feedback sessions with frontline staff during development allowed continuous refinement of the AI's accuracy and relevance, highlighting the importance of iterative, user-centred design in AI projects. 

  * Building user trust is crucial for widespread adoption of AI tools. 

  * Close collaboration with information governance teams and adherence to data protection protocols (Data Protection Impact Assessments, Data Processing Agreements) were crucial to managing risks and ensuring ethical AI deployment.
