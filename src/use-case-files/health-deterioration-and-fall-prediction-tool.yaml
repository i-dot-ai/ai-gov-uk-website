challenge: Preventable hospital admissions, particularly among older adults, place
  significant strain on the NHS. Falls alone account for over 4 million hospital bed
  days and cost the NHS an estimated £2 billion per year. However, early signs of
  deterioration often go unnoticed in home care settings due to limited real-time
  clinical oversight and a reliance on manual reporting.
solution: The tool predicts early signs of health deterioration, including fall risk,
  by analysing vital signs such as temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. This
  information is collected by carers, family members, or healthcare professionals
  using a mobile app. It then generates real-time alerts to enable timely intervention.
  The system also supports care planning, detects illnesses like flu and COVID-19,
  and automates routine tasks such as scheduling and documentation.
results: >-
  * Predicts a patient's risk of falling with up to 97% accuracy, potentially avoiding
  up to 2,000 hospital admissions per day. 

  * As of March 2025, the tool is used in over two-thirds of NHS Integrated Care Systems, identifying up to 5,000 high-risk cases daily to enable care at home and reduce hospitalisations by up to 70%. 

  * It is estimated to save the NHS over £1 million per day by reducing A&E attendances and freeing up hospital beds. 

  * Currently used daily by nearly 10,000 home healthcare professionals, boosting staff efficiency and improving patient outcomes.
