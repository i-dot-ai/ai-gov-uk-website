phase: Live
challenge: Government departments needed to understand if and how AI assistant tools
  could improve productivity, reduce time spent on routine tasks, and enhance overall
  job satisfaction. There was a particular focus on validating the technology's effectiveness
  across varied departments, grades, and job roles while addressing concerns around
  data sensitivity and complex task handling.
solution: The Government Digital Service (GDS) led a cross-government trial of Microsoft
  365 Copilot, an AI assistant available within the Microsoft Office suite that uses
  retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to search and extract relevant information
  to a user's query. The trial was run from September to December 2024 and involved
  20,000 public sector employees across 12 departments. A centralised evaluation approach
  captured quantitative adoption and usage data, alongside qualitative feedback via
  surveys, feedback forms, and focus groups.
results: >-
  Reports from the 3-month trial show: 


  * Users saved an average of 26 minutes per day using M365 Copilot. 

  * Over 70% reported spending less time on mundane tasks and more time on strategic work. 

  * 82% would not want to return to pre-Copilot workflows. 

  * Average satisfaction score was 7.7/10, with an 8.2/10 recommendation score. 

  * Users with accessibility needs experienced notable benefits, indicating strong potential for inclusive innovation. 

  * Users noted challenges around: a steep learning curve for effective prompting and concerns about accuracy, especially with nuanced or context-specific data.
learnings: >-
  * AI assistants can deliver meaningful time savings and enhance job satisfaction in
  government when thoughtfully deployed. 

  * Tailored support and training are essential to drive adoption and maximise benefits. 

  * Seamless integration within widely used platforms (e.g., Teams) boosts adoption and realises greater impact. 

  * AI tools hold untapped potential to improve accessibility, equity, and inclusion.
