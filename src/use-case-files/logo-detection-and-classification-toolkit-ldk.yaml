challenge: Misuse of HMRC, HMG, and Valuation Office Agency (VOA) logos by third-party
  websites poses a serious risk to the public, as these logos falsely imply official
  endorsement or affiliation. This can mislead citizens into paying for services that
  are otherwise free, eroding public trust and exposing users to fraud. To tackle
  this, the team relied on a cumbersome review process that used third-party tools
  to scan the internet, followed by the manual verification of identified URLs. This
  approach was time-consuming and struggled to keep pace with the increasing sophistication
  of online fraudulent activities.
organisationType: Central
phase: Live
solution: Developed in-house, the tool scans the internet for websites misusing HMRC
  or UK Government logos and automatically flags suspicious URLs. It uses [YOLOv11](https://yolov11.com/),
  a powerful open-source object detection model, to identify logos on webpages. The
  findings are presented through an intuitive user interface, enabling fraud analysts
  to quickly review and take action. Following interest from the Government Security
  Centre for Cyber (Cyber GSeC) in rolling out the tool as a service across other
  departments, functionality has been expanded. The tool now allows users to create
  datasets with new logos to support model training and testing, thereby helping strengthen
  cyber resilience across government.
results: >-
  * Cut total process time, which included scanning and flagging sites, from 3 days
  to just 3-4 hours.

  * Has led to 10-20 fraudulent URLs being taken down monthly.

  * Increased protection of government brand integrity and public trust.
