challenge: In [2022-23 alone, Citizen Advice with its national organisation and network
  of 250 independent local charities across England and Wales, helped over 2.5 million
  people with one-to-one advice](https://assets.ctfassets.net/mfz4nbgura3g/1CvI8xMxxf8Qzm8uI2NKbF/ad0eec22a4379960bac66ca4ed5a84a4/Citizens_Advice_Annual_Report_2022-2023.pdf).
  Highly trained advisors have to tackle a broad range of topics, with people often
  seeking help on complex interconnected issues. Thus the need to make it easier for
  the advisors to quickly find and share information with the people seeking  help
  from the charity.

solution: Developed in collaboration with Citizens Advice Stockport, Oldham, Rochdale
  & Trafford (CASORT), Caddy is a human-in-the-loop copilot for front-line contact
  centres. Caddy is designed to support advisors by providing quick, accurate, and
  validated information. It accesses public and internal training and guidance, utilizing
  semantic routing for topic-specific consideration. Generated content is always reviewed
  and validated by advisors and supervisors before being presented. Caddy is accessed
  through existing chat platforms, minimising training needs for advisors.
results: >-
  - Initial results from a randomized control trial showed 80% of Caddy's responses
  were of high enough quality to be passed directly to advisors without revisions.

  - Messages were generated, validated, and returned in approximately 4 minutes, significantly faster than human research and typing.

  - Advisors with access to Caddy were twice as likely to report confidence in giving advice and 1.5 times more likely to resolve client issues.

  - Rolled out to 6 local Citizens Advice offices with plans for further expansion and government pilots.
learnings: >-
  * Building in "humans-in-the-loop" mitigates AI hallucination and risk. 

  * Focusing on ease of use and integration with existing workflows is important for adoption.

  * Measuring impact through randomized control trials provides valuable insights for improvement.
