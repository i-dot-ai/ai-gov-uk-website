challenge: Over 500 pages worth of debate transcripts are added to the parliamentary
  record each day. There is a strong need for tools that can navigate through this
  volume of data and find insight. From researchers and legislators to parliamentarians
  and librarians, we have heard from teams across government are looking for help
  navigating the parliamentary landscape more efficiently, leading to a better overall
  user experience.

phase: Beta
solution: Parlex allows users to navigate Hansard data. By analysing years of parliamentary
  debate contributions from MPs and Peers, Parlex offers insights into how parliament
  might react to a new policy if it were debated tomorrow. This tool helps policy
  professionals gauge parliamentary sentiment towards specific issues, determining
  whether a policy will be well-received or face significant opposition. This allows
  policy teams to understand the political climate and anticipate potential challenges
  or support for a policy before it is formally proposed and to build a parliamentary
  handling strategy.
results: Parlex is still in early-stage user testing. However, in interviews with
  three users, researching a parliamentarian took 1-3 minutes using Parlex. Interviewees
  estimated that the same task would have taken 30-60 minutes without Parlex.
learnings: Use great datasets! By leveraging the existing Hansard API for the Parlex
  product i.AI was able to apply hybrid search and other ML techniques to garner new
  insights into parliamentary business
