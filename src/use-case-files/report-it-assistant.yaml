challenge: The 'Report it' service allows residents, businesses, and visitors to report
  street issues like fly-tipping, graffiti, animal fouling and street noise. However,
  the process required users to fill out forms and manually select the issue type,
  making it time-consuming and prone to errors. This discouraged reporting and led
  to delays in resolution when issues were misclassified.
organisationType: Local
solution: The 'Report it' Assistant (RIA) uses AI to automatically identify the type
  of issue using a combination of image classification (on user-uploaded photos) and
  natural language understanding. This removes the need for users to manually select
  categories, speeding up the reporting process. It also ensures accurate onward triage
  and action, improving the overall resident experience.
results: The AI correctly identified the report category in 86% of cases, leading
  to a 38% reduction in time spent selecting the right category and a 20% drop in
  the number of steps required. Overall, the average time to report an issue fell
  from 3.65 minutes to 1.37 minutes.
learnings: "* Incident triage is a feasible and effective opportunity space for machine-learning
  application."
