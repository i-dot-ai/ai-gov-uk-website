  search and chat

  - Better Customer Experience
phase: Live
challenge: Outside of the top interaction types, residents find it cumbersome to interact
  with the council's website. Furthermore, traditional search functions return an
  overwhelming number of results, making it difficult for users to find relevant information.
  This leaves residents feeling frustrated, leading them to abandon the self-service
  option in favour of calling the contact centre or giving up on the interaction entirely.
organisationType: Local
solution: An LLM-powered tool built with [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search)
  (formerly known as Azure Cognitive Search) that embeds the core, non-ephemeral content
  on the council's website. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer
  plain language queries with concise summaries and direct service links. Users can
  interact via search or chat interfaces. Telephony and WhatsApp channels are planned
  next.
results: >-
  * The AI Search interface is handling 18,000 sessions per month. The first-time hit
  rate on search (i.e., finding the right information with the initial query) is high,
  with low levels of negative feedback. 

  * The AI Chatbot interface is currently serving 4,450 conversations per month, with a 93% success rate based on user feedback (thumbs up / down) at the end of each conversation.

  * The combined impact of the tool across both interfaces has been a reduction in general enquiries and calls into the Council.
learnings: This approach has created a simpler, more efficient way for residents to
  access information and be directed to services. It has become a key part of the
  Council's digital resident engagement strategy. However, the Council still receives
  tens of thousands of telephone calls each month across its services. The addition
  of telephony and WhatsApp channels later this year is expected to significantly
  enhance the experience for residents.
