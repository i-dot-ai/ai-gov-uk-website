phase: Live
challenge: Traditional housing inspections relied heavily on scaffolding, which posed
  safety risks, required extensive setup time, and created accessibility challenges
  for vulnerable populations.
solution: Swindon Borough Council introduced drones for social housing roofing inspections.
  The drones leverage intelligent image analysis to detect roof damage, hazardous
  materials, and structural issues in real time. Supported by a collaborative, cross-council
  team and proactive community engagement, the programme integrated active opt-in
  and nudge theory to drive resident involvement and trust. Staff were trained and
  certified to operate drones, making it a sustainable, in-house capability, while
  also improving workforce happiness.
results: >-
  Within a year of the initial trial: 


  * Inspection time reduced from 64 days to just 17 minutes 

  * Â£80,265 saved annually through improved efficiency and reduced scaffolding use 

  * Zero rework required post-inspection, demonstrating right-first-time repairs 

  * AI identified hazardous materials in 4% of cases, enabling prompt safety interventions 

  * 4% of inspections uncovered non-roofing issues, avoiding unnecessary scaffolding entirely 

  * Average scaffolding hire time cut by 45% 

  * 94% of tenants expressed positive feedback about drone use 

  * Staff reported higher job satisfaction and engagement, driven by new skill development and safer work environments with reduced risk of accidents
learnings: >-
  * Early focus on consent, transparency, and communication builds resident trust in
  tech 

  * Cross-department collaboration ensures innovation is embedded and scalable 

  * Upskilling staff in AI and drone tech improves workforce motivation and service delivery
