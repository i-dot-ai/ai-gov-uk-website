challenge: A stroke is a life-threatening medical emergency in which the blood supply
  to the brain is disrupted. Around 2 million brain cells are lost every minute, making
  every second count. Fast diagnosis and treatment are critical to reducing brain
  damage and improving chances of recovery.
applicationFocus: Assess and Diagnose
organisationType: Central
phase: Live
results: >-
  * Reduced the time to treatment by over 60 minutes, leading to a threefold increase
  in stroke patients recovering with little or no disability from 16% to 48%. 

  * As of Summer 2024, the technology has been rolled out to all 107 stroke units across England, improving care for around 80,000 patients annually.
capability: Computer Vision
solution: The AI-powered decision support tool helps doctors rapidly process and interpret
  brain scans. This enables faster decision-making about the right course of treatment,
  based on the type and severity of stroke.
