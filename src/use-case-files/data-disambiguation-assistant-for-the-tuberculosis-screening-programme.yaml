challenge: The UK's Tuberculosis Screening Programme invites new migrants for testing
  based on their country of birth, using data from GP registration records. However,
  these records often include incomplete, misspelled, or ambiguous place names, resulting
  in messy data that requires extensive manual review. On average, around 40,000 records
  must be reviewed each year to ensure accurate screening.
solution: >-
  The team used AI to automatically match inconsistent place name data to countries,
  significantly reducing the need for manual checks. The solution is now fully integrated
  into the Tuberculosis Screening Programme team's regular workflow. 


   

  NOTE: An Algorithmic Transparency Recording Standard (ATRS) record is currently being prepared.
results: >-
  * Achieved 90% accuracy in correctly identifying country of birth from inconsistent
  data. 

  * Reduced manual review workload by 85%, from 40,000 to 6,000 records per year.
