impact:
  - Cost Savings
  - Time Savings
challenge: The current method of analysing responses is manual and often relies on
  external consultants, costing up to £100,000 per consultation and taking months.
applicationFocus: Knowledge Assistant
organisationType: Central
phase: Beta
solution: Consult is an AI tool to analyse responses to public consultations. It analyses
  the thousands of responses any government consultation might receive in hours, before
  presenting policy makers and experts with interactive dashboards to explore what
  the public are saying directly. Initial testing suggested that the tool would be
  400x cheaper to use for this analysis than the existing methods. With around 500
  public consultations run every year, this single tool could significantly reduce
  the estimated £20m spent on this process and increase its speed and effectiveness.
results: >-
  In an evaluation on a Scottish Government consultation on the regulation of non-surgical
  cosmetic procedures:


  * The overall performance (F1) score was 0.76 out of 1 (generally considered 'good') and reviewers made no changes to the Consult themes for 60% of responses.

  * Differences between Consult and reviewer-identified themes had negligible impact on the overall theme rankings – the key driver of policy recommendations. 

  * Changes to themes were heavily concentrated on a small number of specific themes. This should make it quicker to detect and correct difficult themes early.

  * Reviewing Consult themes is quick, with a median time of 23s per response. By reducing analysis time, Consult freed up time to focus on the implications.
learnings: "* It is important to evaluate both technical performance of a model and how
  it is used to make improvements and build trust."
