challenge: "Across the public sector, millions of public servants deliver critical
  services through meetings, interviews and appointments. They then spend hours processing
  and summarising the outputs of these conversations, filling out forms, writing briefings
  or crafting official minutes. In some cases, dedicated minute takers are used to
  support this process. However, it is not possible for every public sector interaction
  to have a dedicated minute taker. This means that public servants are often required
  to do two jobs at once: be fully present in the conversation while documenting all
  key points of the interaction, ready to feed into a host of structured formats afterwards."
applicationFocus: Transcription
organisationType: Central
phase: Beta
solution: Using a transcription engine and a large language model (LLM), Minute produces
  bespoke summaries in the formats that public servants really need. Users have the
  choice between uploading existing audio and video files, or can record live directly
  in the app.
results: >-
  * In early user testing in central government, Minute reduced the time taken to complete
  minutes for a 60 minute meeting by one hour, which users reallocated to more critical
  tasks. Full Quality Assurance and publication of this analysis is forthcoming.

  * Nearly 90% of users described minuting as the one of the less enjoyable aspects of their job, with nearly half describing it as the 'least enjoyable'.
learnings: >-
  * There is a strong need for AI transcription tooling across the public sector. 

  * There are common templates required across councils, including the statutory requirement to publish official minutes.

  * Working directly with a community of enthusiastic users at an early development stage helps to make important changes early. Local Authorities have strong desire and capability to contribute to these conversations.
