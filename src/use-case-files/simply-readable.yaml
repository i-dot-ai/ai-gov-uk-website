challenge: With [1.5 million people in the UK living with a learning disability](https://www.mencap.org.uk/learning-disability-explained/research-and-statistics/how-common-learning-disability),
  councils must provide accessible information in [Easy Read](https://abilitynet.org.uk/factsheets/what-easy-read)
  formats. Traditional methods are slow and expensive, placing unsustainable pressure
  on resources and risking the exclusion of vulnerable populations from vital information.
organisationType: Local
solution: Developed by Swindon Borough Council using [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/),
  *Simply Readable* is an AI-powered tool that generates Easy-Read documents. Co-created
  with residents with learning disabilities, it features larger fonts, clear language,
  increased spacing, and supporting visuals to meet real user needs.
results: >-
  * Reduced the cost of creation of 5-10 page documents from Â£600 to circa 7-10 pence.

  * Enabled the creation of the documents to be completed in under 30 minutes, compared to weeks using traditional methods.

  * Freed up social worker time, improving frontline service delivery.
learnings: >-
  * Co-designing with target users ensured the solution met real needs, ensuring greater
  user satisfaction.
