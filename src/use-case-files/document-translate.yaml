solution: >-
  Developed using [Amazon Translate](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/) as an open-source
  tool, it allows users to translate full documents in under 15 minutes. The tool
  includes features such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection, configurable
  retention periods for PII and non-PII data, and Single Sign-On (SSO) support via
  [Entra ID](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-single-sign-on).


  The solution was designed to deliver good-quality, readable translations rather than perfect accuracy. User training materials include guidance on how to obtain the best translation results. Additionally, each translation is accompanied by a legal disclaimer explaining the translation process for transparency, along with contact details for further clarification.

  The solution was created by Swindon Borough Council; however, ongoing maintenance has transitioned to [CityTrax](https://www.citytrax.co.uk/solution/translate), a delivery partner.
