synopsis: Simplifying navigation across GOV.UK's pages

organisation: Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) / Government Digital
  Service (GDS)
governmentBody: UK Government
userGroup: General Public
useCaseType: Reusable
typeOfTechnology: Generative AI
impact:
  - Better Customer Experience
phase: Beta
challenge: GOV.UK hosts over 700,000 pages, with new content added regularly. The
  sheer volume renders traditional search and navigation methods less effective. This
  makes it hard for users to quickly find the information they need, especially in
  cases involving more complex queries.
organisationType: Central
solution: >-
  GOV.UK Chat uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, allowing users
  to ask natural language queries and receive relevant information. Safeguards have
  been put in place to protect user privacy. 

  Personal data is removed from the GOV.UK pages accessed by the LLM. The tool is developed in compliance with UK data protection legislation, and a thorough Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) was conducted. Additionally, red teaming exercises were conducted to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
results: Tested by hundreds of users in a controlled environment, the tool demonstrated
  strong potential to improve access to government information. Nearly 70% of users
  found the chatbot's responses useful, and approximately 65% reported satisfaction
  with the overall experience. These experiments have helped the GOV.UK Chat team
  understand the types of user queries and the most common failure modes. It has enabled
  the team to assess the feasibility of integrating such a system more broadly.
learnings: >-
  * Given the frequent updates to GOV.UK content, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  provides better accuracy and relevance in responses compared to fine-tuning a large
  language model (LLM).

  * Automated quality assurance should be a key consideration to consistently maintain high response quality when scaling the solution.
