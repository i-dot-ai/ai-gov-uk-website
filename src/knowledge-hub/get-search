It helps staff learn how to write clearer, more purposeful prompts when working with AI tools like Copilot. \\n\\nLearning Objectives: understand how to structure prompts for clarity, relevance, and impact. Learn how to iterate prompts to improve outcomes. Build confidence in using AI tools responsibly and effectively. \\n\\n//Action\\n\\nGame Structure: the game consists of three rounds; each focused on improving a prompt collaboratively. \\n\\nIntroduction: you explain the purpose of the game and its relevance to project delivery work. \\n\\nTeam Context: ask me to name a team (e.g. “Energy Security”) going out for a meal. This becomes the basis for the initial prompt. \\n\\nInitial Prompt: you generate a basic prompt (e.g. “Write a story about the Energy Security team going out for a meal.”) \\n\\nIteration: we take turns refining the prompt to improve its clarity, creativity, and effectiveness. \\n\\nScoring & Feedback: after each round, you score my version using the following criteria: \\n\\nPurposefulness (1–5): does the prompt clearly support a specific goal or outcome? Purposefulness (1–5): is the prompt specific and easy to understand? \\n\\nEffectiveness (1–5): does the prompt guide Copilot to produce a high-quality response? You also provide a prompt engineering tip after each round. \\n\\nFinal Prompt: At the end of Round 3, we run the final version as a demonstration of learning. Scoring: Each round is scored out of 15 (5 per criterion), with a total score out of 45 at the end. This helps track progress and identify areas for improvement.

Plan for feedback loops (how stakeholder input will be gathered and used) and include a brief note on how engagement success will be measured (e.g. stakeholder satisfaction surveys, issue resolution rates).\\n\\n//Output \\n\\nPresent the engagement strategy as a structured list or table for easy reference, and be ready to prompt for any missing info on stakeholders.\\n\"}","url":"/prompts/build-a-stakeholder-engagement-plan/"},{"title":"Prioritise your workload","type":"prompt","synopsis":"Build a daily or weekly schedule that prioritises your workload using time management best practice.","content":"{\"title\":\"Prioritise your workload\",\"created\":\"1756379391725\",\"updated\":\"1763916688241\",\"description\":\"Build a daily or weekly schedule that prioritises your workload using time management best practice.\",\"category\":\"Learning and development\",\"subcategory\":\"Personal productivity\",\"tags\":\"Productivity, Email / Task Management\",\"use\":\"\",\"content\":\"<p class=\\\"govuk-body\\\">This prompt assumes your AI assistant has access to your emails, calendars and chat messages (for example, Microsoft Copilot or Gemini).</p>\\n<p class=\\\"govuk-body\\\">The prompt will:</p>\\n<ul class=\\\"govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced\\\">\\n<li>act as an AI productivity coach and time management expert</li>\\n<li>help you prioritise your tasks and manage your upcoming schedule</li>\\n<li>ask you to list your tasks, meetings, deadlines, and working hours</li>\\n<li>use proven techniques (for example, the Eisenhower Matrix) to categorise your work</li>\\n<li>suggest an optimised schedule with time slots and breaks</li>\\n<li>present the plan as a clear, realistic list or agenda</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2 class=\\\"govuk-heading-m\\\" id=\\\"beforeyoustart\\\">Before you start</h2>\\n<p class=\\\"govuk-body\\\">Before you use this prompt, replace [SPECIFY PERIOD OF INTEREST] with the period you want to focus on, for example [1 week].</p>\\n<div class=\\\"govuk-inset-text\\\">\\nDo not upload any personal or official information to free tools, or any tool not advised by your department.

(For example: Task A – due tomorrow, high importance; Task B – due next week, low importance; Team meeting Wednesday 2pm; etc. Also ask about my typical working hours and any personal time constraints.)\\n\\nPrioritisation: Using proven techniques (like the Eisenhower Matrix for urgency/importance or MoSCoW priority if relevant), categorise the tasks. Clearly identify high-priority items (“Must Do” urgent/important tasks), vs tasks that can be scheduled later or delegated. Explain briefly why certain tasks are top priority (e.g. deadline nearing, critical for project goals) to reinforce the logic.\\n\\nSchedule Optimisation: Propose an optimised schedule for the period:\\n\\nAllocate time slots for the high-priority tasks, fitting them around fixed calendar events (meetings). For example, suggest dedicating a morning block for the most complex task when energy is high, group smaller tasks into an afternoon block, etc.\\n\\nInclude short breaks or prep time as needed (to follow health and efficiency best practices).\\n\\nIf the calendar is overpacked, suggest what can be rescheduled or declined, defending the choice (e.g. “Consider postponing the internal review meeting – not urgent this week – to free up focus time”).\\n\\n// Output\\n\\nPresent the plan as an ordered list of time blocks or as a day-by-day agenda with tasks assigned to times. Ensure it’s realistic and leaves some buffer for unexpected issues.
