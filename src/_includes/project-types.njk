AI presents an enormous opportunity to make these interactions faster, more personalised and more informed.</p><p>Caddy, our customer service Artificial Intelligence (AI) copilot, helps customer service advisors and supervisors in quickly locating and sharing information from reliable sources. Caddy is currently being piloted in Citizens Advice Manchester and Citizens Advice Stockport, Oldham, Rochdale & Trafford (CASORT). We are considering how Caddy could be used to support other types of advisors in government.</p>'},
    {heading: 'Fraud & error', subHeading: 'Anomaly detection', icon: 'warning.png', content: '<h3>Fraud & error</h3><p>AI is particularly adept at identifying anomalies and analysing patterns in data, which may indicate fraud or error. Public sector fraud and error is estimated to be at least £33bn per year, with a significant portion of this in the tax and welfare system. Cutting this figure raises money for the government to spend on better public services.</p><p>In i.AI we are using similar principles to explore a tool analysing suboptimal prescriptions in community pharmacies, flagging harmful drug interactions and misallocations to save money and lives.</p>'},
    {heading: 'Matching & triage', subHeading: 'Optimisation', icon: 'puzzle.png', content: '<h3>Matching & triage</h3></p>AI can be used to optimise the use of existing resources to create more efficient and more cost-effective public services. When demand is high, there is a clear need to adopt a more intelligent approach to housing asylum seekers, managing prison capacity and availability of hospital beds. Matching algorithms could provide the solution. </p><p>In i.AI we are considering the use of matching algorithms to make better use of available grid capacity, reducing waitlists and increasing investment.</p>'},
    {heading: 'Casework management', subHeading: 'GenAI', icon: 'briefcase.png', content: '<h3>Casework management</h3><p>AI can process, synthesise and analyse paperwork much more quickly than humans and can provide users with new ways to interact with large bodies of text. This can free up Civil Servants from time-consuming tasks and reduce the costs of outsourcing such work.</p><p>i.AI’s tool Redbox includes a range of secure efficiency-generating features to augment the work of government officials. Our consultation tool, Consult, analyses responses to government consultations, seeking to save some of the £80m HMG spends on consultations every year.</p>'},
    {heading: 'Condor', subHeading: 'Databases, APIs, development environment', icon: 'condor.png', content: '<h3>Condor</h3><p>To enable widespread AI adoption and leverage data at scale, it is essential to have the right data infrastructure in government.</p><p>In i.AI we take this seriously. Project rAPId is an open-source end-to-end solution, enabling departments to discover, manage and share high-impact data internally and across government. Work is currently going beyond rAPId to offer open-source, cutting edge cloud infrastructure (Project Condor) that will allow departments to create the infrastructure that suits their data, analytical and AI needs.</p><p>So that is how we view different AI projects in government. The list is not necessarily exhaustive, but provides a helpful framework through which we can filter the many and varied proposals that come our way.</p>'}
