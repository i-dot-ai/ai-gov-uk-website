        <p>Our mission is to harness the opportunity of AI to improve lives, generate efficiency savings and deliver better public services: Introducing Redbox.</p>
        <p>The Cabinet Office is estimated to create 30000 to 80000 documents per year. Navigating these manually is complex and inefficient.</p>
        <p>Redbox harnesses AI to help civil servants summarise and ask questions of documents up to official sensitive.</p>
        <p>Upload your documents: a screenshot of a user navigating to the documents page, uploading a document, and then starting a chat.<p>
        <p>Chat with your Redbox: a screenshot of a user on the chat page, selecting their document and then asking a question. A response is then streamed back to the chat interface.</p>
        <p>Gain summaries. Gain insight. Gain understanding.</p>
        <p>Made for policy civil servants. Made for finance civil servants. Made for commerical civil servants. Made for operational civil servants. Made for all civil servants.</p>

            <p>The Ministerial red box has been the primary destination for state papers since they came into government in the mid 19th century. Redbox was initially envisioned as a way to leverage AI to search through thousands of documents, chat with them and summarise them into tailored briefings. After a hackathon in July 2023, we spun up a small prototyping team with members from the No 10 Innovation Fellowship and Evidence House. Within two months the prototype was being actively trialled within three different Private Offices with Cabinet Office. The trial gave us many future avenues of development and also helped test our rigorous AI safety mechanisms. With this alpha trial complete, we’re now broadening the scope of Redbox to address the entire Civil Service.</p>
            <p class="mt-4">Just like ministers, civil servants deal with a wealth of information on a day to day basis. We’re now in the process of building the next generation of Redbox with the becoming a powerful tool for all departments; built by government, for government.</p>
