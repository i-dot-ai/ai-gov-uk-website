      We're looking for a brilliant manager to join the team, focussing on ensuring i.AI is prioritising our work well, and collaborating effectively with our partners.

      about: [
        `The Incubator for Artificial Intelligence (i.AI) leads the Cabinet Office AI for Public Good programme to harness the opportunities presented by AI to improve the lives of citizens. The 30 strong team, mostly staffed by expert technologists of different flavours, focuses on a number of priority projects in home affairs, health, education and government efficiency projects. The i.AI team will use ethical and secure methods at all times to help deliver better public services.`,
        `Building on the work of No10 Data Science Team (10DS) and other leading technology teams across the civil service, i.AI will experiment and prove what is possible in improving the use of AI across the government.`,
        `The team is part of the Prime Minister’s Delivery Group, building AI based technical solutions to significantly improve delivery of the Prime Minister’s priorities.`,
        `These roles are offered on a two year loan for civil servants, which may be extendable.`,
        `i.AI are a hybrid team based across the country, with a variety of working patterns. We have office space in 70 Whitehall (London) where we work regularly.`,
        `The successful candidate will report into our Head of Strategy, and provide support to make sure the technical work of the team aligns with government and policy priorities. This includes, for example, supporting Ministerial meetings, liaising across Whitehall with teams in CDDO, GDS, HMT, DSIT, and more, and building an external engagement strategy for the team. You will be working with technical leads across i.AI to manage our portfolio of work, ensuring we remain on strategy.`,
        `This is not primarily a policy role. You will be working with a technical delivery team who are building real products to apply AI to public services. Your role is to represent this work and build relationships with partners across other Government Departments (OGDs), Delivery bodies, Ministerial offices, and some external organisations. This will require a strong understanding of the policy landscape, but this role is grounded in delivery.`,
        `This is a radical innovation team, and we hire team members who are collaborative, energetic, and are motivated to “get stuff done”, as well as being optimistic big picture thinkers. This role is perfect for somebody looking to operate in a start-up environment, using their skills and experience in central Government to make things happen for the public good. You will be expected to take initiative, playing a convening function to bring together the whole team, and make i.AI the best it can be. This might mean working outside of your direct remit, for example getting stuck into AI projects, or operational management of the team - if this sounds exciting, we’d love to hear from you!`
      ],
      responsibilities: [
        `Building and successfully delivering an engagement strategy for i.AI, maintaining successful relationships for us as a team with our many collaborators across government and beyond.`,
        `Supporting the Head of Strategy and Director to write high quality proposals and briefs for seniors, such as Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and so on.`,
        `Facilitating meetings, workshops and events that bring together leaders in AI to collaborate.`,
        `Developing high quality and light touch assurance processes that will allow i.AI to join up effectively across Government, but without driving inefficient reporting overheads.`,
        `Working closely with other AI teams across government to jointly develop a government strategy for rapid adoption of AI.`,
        `Supporting communications about the work of iAI, including through working with Whitehall press offices, and through supporting our own communications via Blogs and social media.`,
        `Actively engaging with our delivery and evaluation teams, to make sure that we are prioritising the right projects, and that our projects are delivering what we need to stay on track with our strategy.`,
        `Using your role to support business management of the team, for example by identifying areas where we could work better together, and developing light-touch solutions.`,
        `Supporting the effective management and performance of the team by promoting diversity, inclusion, regular, honest and constructive feedback, and supporting continuous improvement.`
      ],
      skills: [
        `Ability to build wide professional networks quickly: You will have experience of engaging with decision makers and leaders across government. You may have existing professional networks that will get you started in this role (e.g. CO, AI in government, DSIT). You will have the ability to forge new relationships quickly, and collaborate well with others. `,
        `Strategic vision: This role is about strategy. You have experience in leading teams through difficult prioritisation decisions, and communicating vision to others. You are able to think practically about how strategy will be informed by the real world, and turn those insights into ideas that help the team be better. `,
        `Project delivery at pace: You can deliver at pace in a complex environment, knowing how to balance competing priorities, upward manage, and collaborate effectively with others both within and outside of your team. You use your initiative to identify problems and proactively rectify them.`,
        `Experience working on technology, digital, innovation and/or AI: Familiarity with applications of AI in the delivery of public services will be very useful, and/or a track record of advising senior decision makers about issues relating to digital, data and innovation.`,
        `A background in strategy, operations and management. This role does not currently have a direct line management span, but you will be part of the non-technical side of the team who are actively managing the portfolio of i.AI. Any skills you have that are relevant to managing new teams, managing multiple projects, or strategy , for example you may have worked in a start up, a projects team or a consultancy.`
