            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            We are working across Government to identify where targeted applications of AI can make the most radical improvements to existing services and the lives of people who use them.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            Building and expanding on the work of the No10 Data Science team, i.AI will be empowered to use its central position to work across the public sector. Bringing world class skills and expertise to bear on areas of government that would not otherwise have the means to seize the opportunity presented by advancements in AI.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            Our highly empowered engineers and developers will act as entrepreneurs in residence, proactively identifying opportunities to transform service provision.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            We also know that those delivering services on the front line are often best placed to spot opportunities to improve them. Therefore, i.AI will make the most of the expertise and knowledge of our internal customers whilst putting the citizen at the centre of everything we deliver.

            </div>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            As well as delivering tactical projects, our new team will build world leading data sharing and AI infrastructure for use across Government.
            Enabling the entire public sector to harness the opportunities presented by AI.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">One of the first priorities for i.AI will be the delivery of a safe, secure, shared data infrastructure for Government.
            This will eliminate the need for individual service areas to build their own, often resulting in disjointed services,
            additional cost and greater risk.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            Similarly, the team will develop and offer shared AI infrastructure for testing and development purposes.
            This will foster efficiency and collaboration among Government agencies and allow us to evaluate the efficacy of
            AI solutions being deployed right across Government.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            Currently AI efforts in Government are impeded by duplication, lack of infrastructure and issues with scalability,
            causing delivery blockers or outright failure. Our new team will deliver GenAI-as-a-service, for the whole of Government.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            Our new team will also offer their expertise in supporting departments when it comes to procurement and assurance of projects.

            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            Seizing the full potential of technology takes people. We are already upskilling thousands of Civil Servants with technical skills
            that will help them apply AI in their own areas of policy or operational delivery.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            The Incubator for Artificial Intelligence will act as a central pool of truly world class AI experts with exceptional
            technical skills and a passion for improving the delivery of public services.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            To that end, i.AI's expertise will help support the upskilling of thousands of existing Civil Servants in areas like programming,
            engineering, data science and machine learning. This training is already being delivered by initiatives
            such as the ONS Data Science Campus, One Big Thing and Evidence House.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            All three of these initiatives will be supported by i.AI engineers and developers through the delivery of bootcamps,
            seminars and hackathons whereby a broad cross section of the Civil Service can access free technical training.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            Modernising Government requires a higher floor and ceiling of technical skills. We will therefore focus on improving
            the general technical fluency of every Civil Servant regardless of grade and professions, whilst providing specialised
            training to existing experts and those in technical roles.
