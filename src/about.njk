            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            We are working across Government to identify where targeted applications of AI can make the most radical improvements to existing services and the lives of people who use them.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            Building and expanding on the work of the No10 Data Science team, i.AI will be empowered to use its central position to work across the public sector. Bringing world class skills and expertise to bear on areas of government that would not otherwise have the means to seize the opportunity presented by advancements in AI.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            Our highly empowered engineers and developers will act as entrepreneurs in residence, proactively identifying opportunities to transform service provision.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            We also know that those delivering services on the front line are often best placed to spot opportunities to improve them. Therefore, i.AI will make the most of the expertise and knowledge of our internal customers whilst putting the citizen at the centre of everything we deliver.

            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            As well as delivering tactical projects, our new team will build world leading data sharing and AI infrastructure for use across Government.
            Enabling the entire public sector to harness the opportunities presented by AI.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">One of the first priorities for i.AI will be the delivery of a safe, secure, shared data infrastructure for Government.
            This will eliminate the need for individual service areas to build their own, often resulting in disjointed services,
            additional cost and greater risk.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            Similarly, the team will develop and offer shared AI infrastructure for testing and development purposes.
            This will foster efficiency and collaboration among Government agencies and allow us to evaluate the efficacy of
            AI solutions being deployed right across Government.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            Currently AI efforts in Government are impeded by duplication, lack of infrastructure and issues with scalability,
            causing delivery blockers or outright failure. Our new team will deliver GenAI-as-a-service, for the whole of Government.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">

            Seizing the full potential of technology takes people. We are already upskilling thousands of Civil Servants with technical skills
            that will help them apply AI in their own areas of policy or operational delivery.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            The Incubator for Artificial Intelligence will act as a central pool of truly world class AI experts with exceptional
            technical skills and a passion for improving the delivery of public services.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            To that end, i.AI's expertise will help support the upskilling of thousands of existing Civil Servants in areas like programming,
            engineering, data science and machine learning. This training is already being delivered by initiatives
            such as the ONS Data Science Campus, One Big Thing and Evidence House.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            All three of these initiatives will be supported by i.AI engineers and developers through the delivery of bootcamps,
            seminars and hackathons whereby a broad cross section of the Civil Service can access free technical training.
        </p>
            <p class="description text-[15px] text-slate-800 font-light">
            Modernising Government requires a higher floor and ceiling of technical skills. We will therefore focus on improving

        <details class="mt-5">
            <summary><h3 class="inline text-[18px] font-semibold">What is the Incubator for AI (i.AI)?</h3></summary>
            <p class="mt-3 text-[15px]">In November 2023, the Deputy Prime Minister established the ‘Incubator for AI’ or ‘i.AI’ (“I dot A I”), an elite team of highly empowered technical experts at the heart of government. Their mission is to help departments harness the potential of AI to improve lives and the delivery of public services.</p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-[15px]">The early work of the Government’s AI incubator has already proven that it is possible to make effective AI tools for use in the UK Government, and that building these in-house can represent strong value for money. In a few short months, we have delivered the following pilot projects:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc mt-3 pl-4 text-[15px]">
                <li class="mt-3">A <a class="link" href="/projects/consultations">consultation response tool</a> that can read, summarise and triage the responses Government receives to the 700+ consultations that we initiate every year, saving up to £80m annually, and potentially freeing up time for us to undertake more engagement with the public on a broader range of issues.</li>
                <li class="mt-3">A bespoke <a class="link" href="/projects/redbox-copilot">Civil Service AI assistant</a> called ‘Redbox Multitool’ (based on the Ministerial Redbox previously announced) which is tailored for the use of UK government, including a range of secure efficiency-generating features appropriate for central government work.</li>
                <li class="mt-3"><a class="link" href="/projects/caddy">Caddy, an AI powered co-pilot</a> for customer service functions everywhere, currently in trial in Manchester. Built in collaboration with Citizens Advice, it seamlessly integrates into existing systems and provides expert advice to advisors and call handlers. Thanks to "double human in the loop" oversight, Caddy ensures a safe and continuously improving advice service.</li>
                <li class="mt-3">Signing a <a class="link" href="/projects/nhs-collaboration">Collaboration Charter with NHSE</a> to work together on AI, as well as data infrastructure projects to support better operations in healthcare.</li>
                <li class="mt-3">Other early pilot programs are, for example, targeting improving lives and saving costs in prescription medication, reducing asylum costs and streamlining access to the National Grid. More information will be released on these programs as they progress.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-3 text-[15px]">This team was initially established with 30 technical experts, working under the leadership of Dr Laura Gilbert, Downing Street’s Director of Data Science. In February, the Deputy Prime Minister announced an expansion of the team with an additional 40 staff who will focus on bringing these technical products to scale across government.</p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-[15px]">The team is purely staffed by civil servants, most onboarding from the private sector or academia. There are no political roles.</p>

        <details class="mt-5">
            <summary><h3 class="inline text-[18px] font-semibold">How do you choose projects?</h3></summary>
            <p class="mt-3 text-[15px]">The incubator for AI (i.AI) takes AI ideas from ideation to delivery through structured assessment and rapid iteration. We source ideas from across the government, filter and prioritise them based on strategic value, technical feasibility and delivery capability, and scale their impact throughout government through re-usable code modules.</p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-[15px]">i.AI acts as a true incubator sourcing, prioritising and closing projects. The incubator sources ideas from PM / DPM priorities, departmental suggestions, external engagement and internal ideation before filtering them through a series of checks to ensure we’re unlocking rapid value at scale. Checks include valuation of total potential impact, alignment with PM / DPM priorities, and feasibility across technical development and delivery chain. i.AI works in partnership with departments and where we are not best-placed to support we provide AI advisory and convening support.</p>

            <p class="mt-3 text-[15px]">The No10 Data Science Team (10DS) works to improve the way in which key decisions are informed by data, analysis, and evidence using cutting-edge data science techniques. This enables the Government to use the best available evidence, throughout the policy and decision-making process, to drive long-term systems change and enable staff to collectively solve the most pressing policy and delivery challenges.</p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-[15px]">10DS also runs a transformation program including:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc mt-3 pl-4 text-[15px]">
                <li class="mt-3">Project rAPId, a free, open source, lightweight data sharing system</li>

            <summary><h3 class="inline text-[18px] font-semibold">Lots of teams are working on AI solutions. How is i.AI different?</h3></summary>
            <p class="mt-3 text-[15px]">i.AI is an incubator, with an unusually high density of pure technical talent. We are set up to rapidly design, test and pilot ideas for the application of AI in government, and quickly learn what works. We are also empowered to operate with less “red tape” than other civil service teams often expect.</p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-[15px]">However, many excellent teams across the public sector are joining us on our mission to harness AI for the public good - we value our partners and actively seek collaboration where we can work together to deliver better products, faster.</p>
        </details>

        <details class="mt-5">
            <summary><h3 class="inline text-[18px] font-semibold">Why do we need to do this in-house when providers are already making tools to help productivity like Co-pilot or ChatGPT?</h3></summary>
            <p class="mt-3 text-[15px]">External analysis suggests that the UK stands to gain around £40 billion per year in public sector productivity improvements by embracing AI, amounting to <a class="link" href="https://www.institute.global/insights/politics-and-governance/governing-in-the-age-of-ai-a-new-model-to-transform-the-state?utm_source=Social&utm_medium=Author&utm_campaign=fob_governing_ai_faculty">£200 billion over a five-year forecast</a> and could help <a class="link" href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/publications/ai-bureaucratic-productivity-measuring-potential-ai-help-automate-143-million-uk">automate around 84% of repetitive transactions across 200 government services</a>.This does mean that there is a place for use of off-the shelf products, especially some of the productivity tools that are already provided by government IT contracts. However, many of these savings can only be achieved by building bespoke tools by government, for government. Building our own capability gives us the added benefit of increasing transparency and knowing exactly how our models are producing their outputs, therefore reducing the ‘black box effect’. In addition, bringing this type of expertise directly into government enables us to be more agile and respond more quickly to changing threats and opportunities.</p>

            <summary><h3 class="inline text-[18px] font-semibold">How is this work governed?</h3></summary>
            <p class="mt-3 text-[15px]">This work has ministerial oversight through the Ministerial Forum on Public Sector AI Adoption. The Forum, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, convenes departmental AI Ministers to provide strategic oversight, guidance, and direction to ensure the effective and responsible implementation of AI technologies within the public sector.</p>
            <p class="mt-3 text-[15px]">More generally, It is the role of the Central Digital and Data Office (CDDO), in the Cabinet Office, to establish the government's approach to new technologies. CDDO has convened external experts and digital leaders across government to rapidly respond to developments in this area. CDDO is working with departments, the Incubator for AI and DSIT to define approaches to assure the safety of AI systems, and exploring the use of automated tools to provide additional assurance.</p>
