challenge: Teachers face high workload pressures, managing time-consuming tasks like
  marking, lesson planning, and administrative work. While AI offers promising solutions,
  current tools often fall short. A major limitation is their lack of access to high-quality,
  reliable educational data, which limited effectiveness and reduces trust among educators.
organisationType: Central
phase: Beta
solution: A centralised content store is being developed to consolidate government
  educational resources. It brings together curriculum guidance, lesson plans, and
  anonymised pupil assessments. This repository is designed to support the training
  of AI models, enabling the development of accurate, high-quality, and legally compliant
  educational tools tailored for schools.
