challenge: Social workers face growing administrative burdens, particularly with documentation
  and assessment write-ups, reducing the time available for direct client care. Traditional
  note-taking methods limit efficiency, as practitioners must complete detailed reports
  after visits to preserve personal engagement during sessions.
solution: Kingston Council worked with Beam to create Magic Notes, an AI transcription
  tool for social care. It was developed within three months through close collaboration
  with social workers and occupational therapists, who tested early versions and provided
  feedback. The AI was trained on anonymised real-world data, with strong governance
  in place to mitigate potential risks. Furthermore, a Data Processing Agreement (DPA)
  was established with Beam, and a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) was completed.
results: >-
  * Practitioners reported time savings of 50-60% on administrative tasks such as completing
  case notes and assessments.

  * Time required for supervision write-ups dropped from 40 minutes to under 10 minutes.

  * Transcription accuracy exceeded expectations, reaching over 96%.

  * The pilot identified a potential 50% reduction in administrative time, enabling resources to be reallocated toward prevention services.
learnings: >-
  * Different types of supervisions required different templates, highlighting the need
  for context-specific design.

  * The tool was found to be less effective for users with low verbal communication and scenarios with poor audio quality.
