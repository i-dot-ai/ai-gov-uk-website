challenge: The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) receives approximately
  100,000 written consular enquiries annually from British nationals abroad, covering
  issues such as lost passports or marriage overseas. Responding to these manually
  led to delays, with response times stretching to several days, limiting the speed
  and efficiency of consular support.
organisationType: Central
phase: Beta
solution: An AI-powered system leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automatically
  match user enquiries to pre-written, pre-approved response templates. The tool provides
  immediate guidance and relevant information, thereby enabling faster self-service.
  If users require further assistance, they can still submit enquiries for human review.
  The AI system minimises hallucinations by suggesting only vetted templates rather
  than generating free-text responses.
results: "* Reduced written enquiries by 80% and calls by up to 50% within three months
  of implementation. It is projected to save the FCDO millions over five years, while
  maintaining accuracy and safety standards."
