challenge: The NHS Breast Screening Programme in NHS Grampian faced the challenge of
  improving breast cancer detection rates while managing growing pressure on radiologist
  capacity and reducing unnecessary patient recalls. Traditional screening methods
  rely on double reading, where two radiologists independently review each mammogram.
  If they disagree, a third expert is required to make the final decision. This process
  is highly resource-intensive and difficult to scale.

  If they disagree, a third expert is required to make the final decision. This process
  is highly resource-intensive and difficult to scale.
results: Mia was developed to support radiologists by automatically analysing mammograms
  and recommending whether further investigation is needed. The system processes images
  securely by removing all identifiable patient data before analysis. It enables radiologists
  to benefit from AI-assisted double reading without increasing reporting time or
  requiring additional clinical resources.
learnings: >-
  Results from the pilot:


  * Detected 10.4% more cancers than standard practice, marking a substantial boost in early breast cancer identification.

  * Up to 36% reduction in radiologist workload, streamlining the screening process without increasing unnecessary recalls.  

  * Potential to reduce patient notification times from 14 days to just 3, helping to ease anxiety and accelerate care.
