challenge: The Warm Home Discount (WHD) scheme provides a £150 rebate for low-income
  households. Previously, eligibility required households to apply to an energy supplier
  for rebates, which were allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. This manual
  application process limited the scheme's ability to reach all eligible households,
  especially considering the 27 million households across England and Wales.
organisationType: Central
phase: Live
solution: The system uses a log-linear regression model to predict energy costs based
  on property characteristics such as property type, age, and floor area, alongside
  an imputation model to fill gaps in missing data. These predictions are matched
  with benefits data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to identify eligible
  households. A rigorous appeals process allows customers to challenge decisions if
  they believe they are eligible for the scheme.
results: >-
  * In 2023/24, over 90% of the total 3 million rebates were issued automatically. 

  * The implementation of this solution has made the process fairer by eliminating the first-come, first-served system. As a result, vulnerable customers who may not have been aware of the support available are now proactively identified and included.
