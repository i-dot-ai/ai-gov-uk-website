challenge: Accessing mental health support can be a [difficult first step for many people](https://www.oxfordhealth.nhs.uk/news/limbic-chatbot-talking-therapies/).
  Traditional self-referral methods such as web forms or phone calls can be time-consuming
  and [often feel off-putting to patients](https://transform.england.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/digital-playbooks/workforce-digital-playbook/using-an-ai-chatbot-to-streamline-mental-health-referrals/),
  leading to high drop-out rates. This not only delays access to care but also places
  additional pressure on NHS services.
organisationType: Central
solution: Limbic Access is an AI-powered chatbot that streamlines the referral process
  for [NHS talking therapies](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/talking-therapies-medicine-treatments/talking-therapies-and-counselling/nhs-talking-therapies/).
  It offers an interactive, patient-friendly experience, guiding users through the
  referral process, replacing lengthy traditional forms. It reduces administrative
  workload for clinicians by collecting essential patient data, screening individuals,
  and flagging high-risk cases for prioritisation. By providing a more efficient,
  accessible and personalised path to mental health support, Limbic Access enhances
  patient engagement and ensures timely care.
