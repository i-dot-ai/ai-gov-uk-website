challenge: Many teachers experience high workloads due to repetitive and time-intensive
  lesson planning tasks. While generative tools may offer support in this area, teachers
  are concerned about the accuracy, bias, and safety of AI-generated educational content.
  There is a need for AI tools to support the creation of curriculum-aligned resources
  that meet varied pupil requirements while maintaining teacher oversight.

  Aila, developed by Oak National Academy (an arm's length body of the Department for
  Education), is an AI-powered lesson assistant designed to help teachers create personalised,
  curriculum-aligned lesson plans swiftly and efficiently. It combines a large language
  model (currently OpenAI's GPT-4o) with retrieval-augmented generation to draw from
  Oak's extensive, 

  high-quality and quality-assured lesson repository, ensuring content accuracy and relevance. Teachers interact with Aila through a chat interface to generate lesson outlines, which can be refined iteratively.


  To maintain safety and appropriateness, a separate moderation agent screens all outputs for harmful or biased content. The generated lessons follow Oak's established pedagogical format, including starter quizzes, slide decks, worksheets, and exit quizzes. In addition, Oak uses an auto-evaluation tool powered by language models to continuously monitor and improve content quality, addressing issues such as bias and pedagogical rigour. This approach aims to reduce teacher workload while maintaining high standards and enabling personalisation.
