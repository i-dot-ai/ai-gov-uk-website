  - Improved Efficiency
challenge: The Ministerial red box has been the primary destination for state papers
  since they came into government in the mid-19th century. Redbox was initially envisioned
  as a way to leverage AI to search through thousands of documents, chat with them
  and summarise them into tailored briefings.
applicationFocus: Knowledge Assistant
organisationType: Central
phase: Beta
solution: Just like Ministers, civil servants deal with a wealth of information on
  a day to day basis. The Incubator for AI (i.AI) decided to streamline Redbox to
  improve user experience and build an app that can scale to a bigger user base. Redbox
  provides an easy and cheap way for civil servants to chat with LLMs (up to an OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE
  level). i.AI has rolled out Redbox to the Cabinet Office (CO), 10 Downing Street
  (No10) and the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT).
results: >-
  An initial survey with 282 Redbox users revealed the following:


  * Net Promoter Score of 56.

  * 80% of respondents said that they think having access to Redbox improves the quality of their work.

  * 89% of respondents said that they think having access to Redbox saves them time.

  * 269 people told us about the task that they used Redbox for most often. The median estimated time saving on this task was 2 hours per week.
learnings: >-
  * Context is everything! Users want AI to understand the datasets that they rely
  on, including specific and sensitive examples like national security data feeds,
  or more general ones such as Hansard. 

  * There are many ways civil servants can be using LLMs (including some we did not expect).
